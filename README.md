# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse data around UFO sightings. To do this, two things were built: a webpage that allows users to view the data and a dynamic table that presents it. JavaScript was utilized to build the table using data stored in a JavaScript Array and create filters designed to make the table fully dynamic. The newly filtered table was placed into a customized HTML file for easy viewing. The webpage was enhanced using Bootstrap to spruce up the appearance for viewers.

## Results
A preview of the website is below. Please note: by default, every single UFO sighting is shown in the bottom table until filtered.

Follow these instructions to find specific UFO sightings:
1. Utilize the provided filters on the left side of the table to input desired constraints in the boxes that are highlighted in yellow. 
2. Examples of the required input format are shown greyed out inside the boxes. 
3. Once you input a filter into one or more of the input boxes, press "Enter" on your keyboard and the respective filtered UFO sighting data will appear in the table to the right which is also highlighted in yellow in the preview. 
4. To clear out a search or remove one of the filters, simply delete the text in the text box you no longer want filtered and press "Enter" on your keyboard, and that will automatically remove that respective filter from the table on the right.

Enjoy!

## Summary

**What is a drawback of the design of this webpage?**

One drawback of this design is that only single inputs can be entered for each category, so the user is limited to very specific sightings.

**What are two recommendations for further development**
1. The first recommendation for further development would be to allow the users to input multiple filters to a category. This would allow the user to view UFO sightings for multiple states, countries, cities, and shapes that they are interested in.
2. The second recommendation would be to improve the date filter to allow the user to input either multiple dates, or add date ranges. This would either include adding a slide-bar where the beginning and the end date could be selected (for the duration) and could be dragged either way to cover specific date intervals, or different input boxes for start and stop dates could be added that would directly take the input and made into the range.
3. Since those are somewhat similar, a final third recommendation would be to make the page responsive to mobile devices as right now it is not as user-friendly to them as it could be.
